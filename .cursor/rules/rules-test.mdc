# TypeScript and Web Development Standards

These guidelines define the technical standards for our application development, covering frontend, backend, and testing practices.

## Language and Typing

* **TypeScript Requirement:** Use TypeScript for all new files.
* **Type Safety:** Avoid using `any` type - prefer proper type definitions.

## Frontend Development

* **Styling Approach:** Use styled-components for styling frontend components.

## Testing

* **Testing Framework:** Use Vitest for writing tests.
* **Mocking Library:** Use vitest-mock-extended for mocking dependencies.

## Backend Development

Our backend technology stack includes:

* **Runtime:** Node.js
* **Dependency Injection:** Inversify.js
* **ORM:** Prisma
* **Architecture:** Repository Pattern
