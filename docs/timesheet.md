# Webapp Timesheet

This document details the time I have spent working on this project. While the 2022 entries are less granular due to fewer intermediate commits, the 2023 records are much more detailed. For additional verification, you can cross-reference these estimates with my commit history and GitHub Actions run logsâ€”these figures represent conservative estimates of my efforts.

Total time spent: 376.5 hours
